  abstract: "Molecular biology, healthcare and medicine have been slowly morphing into large-scale, data driven sciences dependent on machine learning and applied statistics. Many of the same challenges from other domains are applicable here: causality vs association; covariate shift; hidden confounders; heterogenous target space; model validation; (multiple) hypothesis testing; feature engineering (owing to relatively small data sets). In this talk, I will go over domain-specific instantiations of some of these problems, along with proposed solutions. In particular, I will start by presenting modelling challenges in finding the genetic underpinnings of disease, which is important for screening, treatment, drug development. Assuming that we have uncovered genetic causes, genome editing—which is about deleting or changing parts of the genetic code—will one day let us fix the genome in a bespoke manner. Editing will also help researchers understand mechanisms of disease, enable precision medicine and drug development, to name just a few more important applications. I will close this talk by discussing how we have advanced CRISPR gene editing with machine learning."
