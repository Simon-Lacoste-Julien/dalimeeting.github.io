   <p>DALI is designed as a family-inclusive meeting and every participant is encouraged 
	   to bring their families along. There will be activities organised for families, and time 
	   for everyone to be together. 
	   <br><br>
	
	During the long lunch break on Friday, we will take everyone for a real safari experience. We have 
	 booked a guided game drive (3h) at Botlierskop (<a href="https://www.botlierskop.co.za" target="_blank">https://www.botlierskop.co.za</a> where we will hopefully 
	 be able to see lions, elephants, zebras, hippos and more.
	<br><br>

	   We will leave the hotel together by bus at 1:00pm (everyone will get a lunch box on the bus) and 
	   come back in the evening at 6:00pm giving everybody enough time to take a quick shower and relax 
	   before the last keynote of the day and the conference dinner afterwards.
<br><br>
           We have booked tickets for all participants and family members. Please let us know if you do not
	   want to or cannot attend.
